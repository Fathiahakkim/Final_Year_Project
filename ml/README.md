# ML Workspace

## Purpose

Offline machine learning workspace for dataset preparation, feature extraction, model training, and model export.

## Responsibilities

- **Dataset Preparation**: Collect, clean, and preprocess automotive fault data
- **Feature Extraction**: Engineer features from raw data
- **Model Training**: Train machine learning models for fault detection
- **Model Export**: Export trained models for deployment to the backend

## Scope Limitations

This component does **NOT** include:
- Runtime inference code (handled by backend)
- API serving logic

## Development Notes

- This is an offline workspace - not used at runtime
- Focus on model development, training, and evaluation
- Export trained models in formats compatible with backend deployment
- Work independently from frontend and backend teams
